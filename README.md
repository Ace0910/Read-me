Lyrics::

"If the whole world was watchin' i'd still dance with u <3"

"You should see when you not around and it's just us h***y poets who can't wait to write it down, swear were only being honest"

"You won't find him down on sunset Or at a party in the hills At the bottom of the bottle Or when you're tripping on some pills When they sold you the dream you were just 16 Packed a bag and ran away And it's a crying shame you came all this way 'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA"

"And I stayed up, chain-smoking in the kitchen Until you got home and the curtains were on fire Frick, I'm sorry you feel all alone With the T.V. blasting shadows on my face Hitching back to the apartment It was such a lonely place I place my head between my knees and think "Do you ever have nights like these?""

Things u dont know abt me:

I draw when I'm sad, giving is how I show people I love them,  I want to hear what people are upset abt more than I want to talk abt myself, and Im bipolar (now i realie how obvious it is lol) (:

Future:

I don't think about the future often, but when I do, I see myself with 2 dogs. I'm not 100 percent sure which job I'd want, but I'm thinking of a criminal attorney, a teacher, a psycho therapist, or an artist.

My DREAM school is Yale or the University of Utah. (I know, very different)

If your ever sad:

I like the songs bullet, Nights Like These, anything 4 U!, and Not allowed!!! (:
